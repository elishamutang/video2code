**Name:** Melon Husk

**Age:** 19

**Occupation:** Undergraduate student in Computer Science

**Background:** Melon is a male undergraduate student who just enrolled in a Computer Science undergraduate degree and is also blind since birth. He fell in love with coding at a very young age of 10 after being exposed to Python by his father (a professional programmer). He has built various personal CLI projects on his own using Python purely for fun and out of his own interests while not necessarily adhering to best practices. He has tried web development but found it too challenging at the time. However, he aspires to become a full-stack software engineer and wants to work within the web development industry to make it more accessible for people with disabilities.

**Goals:** 

- To improve on his current coding capabilities using Python.
- Pickup JavaScript to learn how to make web applications development more accessible.
- To gain a better understanding of software development lifecycle and how it plays an important part in designing and building software for real users.
- To gain experience in building software within a team environment.

 **Pain Points:** 

- Difficulty when learning via coding videos and tutorials as he finds it difficult to follow the code structure.
- Difficult when learning via coding videos while taking notes at the same time.
- Can't reply on visual aids such as diagrams and flowcharts from videos.

**Behaviour Patterns:** 

- Melon is very enthusiastic to improve his skills and learn new coding concepts. He often takes the initiative to use his free time to practice his skills and learn.
- Melon is comfortable using the command line interface.
- Melon has a Windows PC but often uses WSL for coding projects.
- Melon is not shy and will always ask questions when he doesnâ€™t understand something.

**Preferred Tools and Technologies:** 

- Screen Reader: JAWS or NVDA.
- IDE: VS Code with accessibility plugins.
- Operating System: Windows with WSL installed.
- Programming Languages: Python

**Quote:** 

- Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.
